👋 Hi, I’m Omar, your friendly neighborhood dream chaser!
👀 I’m interested in being rich in experiences, knowledge, and maybe a little cash too!
🌱 I’m currently learning how to turn my ideas into gold mines. 💰
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make the world a bit more awesome.
📫 How to reach me? Just follow the scent of freshly brewed coffee and you'll find me coding away.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His, but you can call me "The Future Billionaire."
⚡ Fun fact: I once traded a paperclip for a house. Okay, not really, but I'm working on it!
